# Binary & Bit-Level Reference Implementations in JavaScript

This repository contains **reference implementations for working with bits, bytes, and numbers in JavaScript**

Originally made for IoT platforms like [Datacake](https://datacake.de/) and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), to be used in **payload decoders** for sensor data. The goal is to provide accurate, spec-faithful, bit-level implementations that can be used for learning, testing, or reference purposes.
