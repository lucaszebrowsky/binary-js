# Binary / Bit Manipulation Library in JavaScript

This is a small JavaScript library for working with bits, bytes, and numbers — perfect for IoT sensor data and payload decoding.

Originally made for IoT platforms like [Datacake](https://datacake.de/) and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), to be used in **payload decoders** for sensor data. The goal is to provide accurate, spec-faithful, bit-level implementations that can be used for learning, testing, or reference purposes.
